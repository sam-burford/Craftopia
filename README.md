## Overview
This is a learning project that serves as a simple web application built using C# ASP.NET. The main purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in developing a web application that reads product information from a flat-file database (JSON file) and displays it to users. Throughout the development of this project, I have learned and practiced various technologies and concepts including C#, HTML, JavaScript, Razor, Blazor, and ASP.NET components, services, and controllers.

## Project Features
1. Product Information Display
The core functionality of this web application is to read product information from a JSON flat-file database and display it to users. The product data includes details such as product name, description, price, and image.

2. ASP.NET MVC Architecture
This project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components: Models (representing the data), Views (displaying the data), and Controllers (handling user requests and managing the flow of data).

3. Razor Views
Razor views are used to define the HTML templates and layout of the web pages. Razor is a view engine that allows embedding C# code directly into HTML, enabling dynamic content generation.

4. Blazor Component
Blazor is a modern web framework for building interactive web applications using C# and .NET. In this project, a Blazor component is used to enhance the user interface and provide a responsive and interactive user experience.

5. Services and Dependency Injection
The project leverages the concept of services and dependency injection to manage and share application functionality across different components. This promotes code modularity and reusability.

6. JSON Flat-File Database
A JSON file is used as a flat-file database to store product information. The application reads data from this file, demonstrating how to work with external data sources.

## Learning Outcomes
This learning project has provided me with valuable experience and skills, particularly in the realm of backend web development using C# ASP.NET:

ASP.NET Mastery: I gained a solid understanding of ASP.NET, including MVC architecture, Razor views, and Blazor components.

C# Proficiency: My C# programming skills have improved significantly as I implemented various backend logic and data retrieval processes.

Dependency Injection: I learned how to use dependency injection to manage and share services and components efficiently.

Data Handling: Working with a JSON flat-file database helped me grasp the basics of data storage and retrieval in web applications.

Web Development Basics: This project has given me a foundation in web development, including HTML, JavaScript, and responsive web design principles.

## Future Enhancements
While this project served as an excellent learning experience, there are several ways to expand and improve it in the future:

Implement user authentication and authorisation for secure access to certain features.

Add the ability to update and delete products, creating a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. 

Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements and better styling.

Optimise the performance of the application, especially when dealing with larger datasets.

## Conclusion
This C# ASP.NET learning project has been a valuable opportunity to explore and apply various technologies and concepts related to backend web development. It has equipped me with essential skills and knowledge to continue building more complex and feature-rich web applications in the future. By focusing on the backend development aspects of ASP.NET, I have laid a solid foundation for further growth in this field.
